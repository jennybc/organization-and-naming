Short lectures to use in the [Organization lesson](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/rr-organization1) of the Reproducible Science Curriculum.

The plan is to move this content over to the main repository! Why here now? I'm vexed by Keynote ... easiest for me but not a great format to contribute stuff in. Also still very rough. But mostly the Keynote dilemma.

Mini-lectures:

  * [Organizing files into directories](organization/)
  * Naming files
  * Picking file formats
